# Wireshark Packet Capture and Protocol Analysis

## 🎯 Objective
To capture live network traffic using Wireshark and identify at least 3 different network protocols.

## 🛠 Tool Used
- **Wireshark**: A powerful network protocol analyzer used for network troubleshooting, analysis, and communications protocol development.

## 📁 File Analyzed
- `networkcapture.pcapng`

## 🔍 Protocols Identified
1. **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):**
   - Ensures reliable and ordered delivery of data between systems.
   - Used in most internet communication like web browsing, file transfer, etc.

2. **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol):**
   - Resolves IP addresses to MAC (hardware) addresses in a local network.
   - Essential for LAN communication.

3. **IGMP (Internet Group Management Protocol):**
   - Manages multicast group memberships for efficient data distribution to multiple recipients.

## 📝 Sample Packet Insights
- **TCP**: Initiated a handshake for establishing a reliable connection.
- **ARP**: Sent request to resolve gateway IP to MAC.
- **IGMP**: Sent a multicast membership report to join a group.

## 📌 Outcome
This task provided hands-on experience with packet capturing, filtering, and analyzing network traffic. It improved understanding of how different protocols operate and interact in real-time communication.

## 📂 Files Included
- `networkcapture.pcapng` – Captured network traffic.
- `Wireshark_Analysis_Report.pdf` – Summary report of identified protocols.
